# WME - Web Markdown Editor

This Web Markdown Editor uses Flask, HTML, CSS, and some cheeky javascript to render markdown files live, and you can preview them as you type. This is especially helpful  for people who are just learning markdown, and want to use it for:

- Note Taking
- Code Annotation
- Just to learn a cool language!
